# parse-server-fs-store-adapter

Use your file system for parse-server storage. Based on parse-server-fs-adapter

After parse-server-fs-adapter didn't work for me i.e. getting errors like those:

https://github.com/ParsePlatform/parse-server/issues/1766  
https://github.com/parse-server-modules/parse-server-fs-adapter/issues/3

I read the source code of the Grid Store Adapter as an inspiration
and used the functions of parse-server-fs-adapter.  

Please read the source, it's short and it works.
